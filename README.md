# HangmanProject
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where a player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The guessing player wins if they correctly guess all the letters to complete the word before the hangman diagram is fully drawn. The host wins if the hangman drawing is completed first, meaning the guesser ran out of allowed incorrect guesses.
